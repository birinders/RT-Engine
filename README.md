# RT-Engine, C++

This is a basic Ray-Tracing Engine I've implemented from the absolute ground up in C++.
The Engine is capable of accurately ray tracing shapes like spheres, and any other shape(s) that can be represented by mathematical equations.

The engine is technically a path tracer, and relies on vector math, and clever mathematical shortcuts (like Schlickâ€™s Approximation for Dielectric Materials) to produce the desired results, at a relatively lower computational expense. The engine also accurately simulates a camera, with adjustable focal depth, aperture, and can accurately simulate a defocus blur on a set distance, or focal length. The engine has built in anti-aliasing in order to smoothen out any outputs, as well as the anti-aliasing module forming an essential part of the shading algorithm. 

Since the engine is not reliant on polygons or similar methodology, it can (theoretically) simulate objects at near infinite resolution.

The engine can currently ray trace 4 different materials-
Glass (Dielectrics), Metals, Fuzzy (Matte) Metals, and Lambertian (solid) surfaces.

This engine relies on vector mathematics, and can ray trace 3d shapes which can be expressed in the form of equations, like spheres and tori (doughnut shape). This engine can also export the renders in the form of PPM images, which can be converted to other formats by suitable means. 

This version of the engine uses the OpenGL library just to output the rendered image to a screen. We can completely avoid using it if we use the built in image exporter, which exports the image as a PPM file instead of displaying it to a window. This completely eliminates the requirements of all external dependencies in the project.

### Why I made this project-
I built this project as my Computer Graphics project submission in my 6th semester. The assignment required us to build any 2d project using the OpenGL toolkit for C++, but that fell short of my expectations, like almost cheating your way through a hurdle.
Since ray tracing in computer games always piqued my interest, this presented the perfect opportunity to integrate these common interests. Hence, it was decided that this project shall be built from ground up, with no external dependencies.

This engine is implemented in C++ due to the extremely strict performance requirements of the project. A 16:9, 1080p image at 100x Anti Aliasing Sampling with 50+ spheres of mixed types takes nearly 20 minutes to render a single frame in C++. Another reason for this relatively slow performance even in C++ is the lack of GPU leverage, or even the other CPU cores, as the application is currently entirely single-threaded. We can make monumental speed gains by introducing multi-processing into the program, such that each individual process is responsible for rendering its own independent part of the frame.
Therefore, while Python would've significantly cut down on the development time, the project would've been practically unusable at Python's runtime speed.
Hence, C++ was my language of choice for this project.

Another reason to choose C++ for me was that while I find myself working most comfortably with Python, I never had a real middle-to-large scale project with any other languages.
Since I worked with C++ before I ever switched to Python, now combined with the 3 years of understanding of the subject, I felt I had adequate knowledge to proceed and step out of my comfort zone, and build a project in another language.
While python would've provided something for me in its standard modules (along with a beautiful GC), I believe this project taught me more than just Python ever would've alone.
